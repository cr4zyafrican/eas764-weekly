####  What do I Bring?

optimism, work ethic, problem solving, good communications skills.

#### What do I Hope to Learn

how to quickly analyze code, and contribute (code) in a meaningful way to an existing project. This includes learning the contribution guidelines set forth by the project leaders, and communicating with others working on the project effectively.

#### Worries

Where to start! Many open source projects are large and the issues so varied that it seems overwhelming to make a significant contribution to one of these projects. So, I donâ€™t know where to start with a project to get involved in such a way that I will eventually make a contribution to this project. I am also worried about communication. If I am having a hard time solving a bug will there be people working on that project that engage in conversation with me and help me work through the bug? I am also worried about learning the contribution guidelines for the given open source project I choose to work on.
