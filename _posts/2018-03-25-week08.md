## FreeCodeCamp!

I would consider this project to have humanitarian aspects. This site teaches you how to code for free, and when you complete a project you can get certificates of completion to show that you have been working on that certain project. I consider this a humanitarian project because the people that work on this project are improving the lives of other people. Learning how to code can offer enjoyment to the novice programer who is eager to learn, and could down the road help them procure a job that will better their life. 

## Progress 

As a group all of us besides (1 or 2) has the dev environment installed and working! We have also collected closed issues and open issues that we will discuss and look at as a group to help us get familiar with the project. 

## What Can I Do

I can find more closed issues and open beginner level issues so that others in the group can study them. I can also study these issues and all the issues that have been collected by my other group members. I can also join the slack for zulip and monitor current discussion on issues and comb through past forums on older issues that have been thoroughly discussed.
