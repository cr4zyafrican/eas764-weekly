## Group Progress 

We have made decent progress on this [issue](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/8750)! We have found all the files involved with this bug, and found that the server is not issuing a get request when it should be issuing one to update the message topic to newly subscribed streams. The next step will be finding out why the get request is not being issued, and implementing code that will implement a get request to the server so that the message topic is updated properly.
