### How I Selected My Article

<p>
  At first I tried to go to the wikipedia page where the pages that are listed either need links updated or citations fixed. Unfortunately I couldn't find any pages that interested me in the needs work section. So, then I chose the article about the BMW M3, because it is one of my favorite sports cars.

### What Did I Contribute?

<p>
  Two years after BMW released the updated M3 in 2014 they came out with the competition package for the M3. It added a host of performance options to the M3. In the article about the M3 where the competition package was being described, it was not mentioned that package came with upgraded wheels for the M3. So, I added the info that the competition package also adds upgraded wheels to the M3.
