### Team Assessment and Plan 

#### Strengths and Weaknesses

All members of the group are fluent in one of the languages that ZULIP is written in, so this will make understanding the existing code easier, and will more easily allow us to make a coding contribution to ZULIP.  

In terms of weakness, no one in our group has contributed to OSS before this class, so I assume there will be a learning curve we will have to get over before we can make a significant contribution to a large OSS project like ZULIP. In addition, none of us have ever worked in a group together before, so there may also be some growing pains as we get comfortable with each others working habits/style, and as more strengths and weaknesses are discovered within the group we will have to adjust how we approach problems.
